# CryptoApp

## Overview

This mobile application is designed to provide a convenient way to convert normal text into cipher text using two encryption algorithms: Caesar Cipher and Binary Encryption. It offers a user-friendly interface and the ability to select the encryption method of your choice.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher Encryption:** Encrypt your text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm, which involves shifting the letters in the text by a fixed number of positions.
- **Binary Encryption:** Encrypt your text using Binary Encryption, which converts text characters into their binary representations.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt previously encrypted text using the same algorithms and key.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for easy text input and encryption.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Copy the encrypted text to your device's clipboard for easy sharing.
- **Dark Mode:** The app supports both light and dark themes for user customization.

## How to Use

1. Launch the mobile application on your Android device.
2. You will be greeted with the home screen.
3. Enter the text you want to encrypt in the provided input field.
4. Select the encryption method: Caesar Cipher or Binary Encryption.
5. If you're using Caesar Cipher, enter the encryption key (shift value).
6. Press the "Encrypt" button to convert your text into cipher text.
7. The encrypted text will be displayed in the result field.
8. You can copy the encrypted text to the clipboard for sharing or saving.
